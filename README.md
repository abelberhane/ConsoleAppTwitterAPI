# Console App Twitter API

My first attempt at using an API token and working with the Twitter API. I was able to create a Console application in C# that utilized the
Twitter API and push a Hello World Tweet out. The application notified me that the tweet was indeed sent out and I checked on the Twitter
page and it was confirmed as well. 

I am not too familiar with API's but I have enjoyed working with them from what I have seen. I am interested to see what other uses I could 
have and look forward to some more complex applications.
