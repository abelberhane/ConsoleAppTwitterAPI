# Console App Twitter API

My first attempt at using an API token and working with the Twitter API. I was able to create a Console application in C# that utilized the
Twitter API and push a Hello World Tweet out. The application notified me that the tweet was indeed sent out and I checked on the Twitter
page and it was confirmed as well. 

I am not too familiar with API's but I have enjoyed working with them from what I have seen. I am interested to see what other uses I could have and look forward to some more complex applications.

I was able to work on this earlier this morning and got the Image sending functionality to work. Now you are able to retrieve images from any folder you would like and tweet it out with a status. There was some trial and error in the beginning but the biggest culprit seemed to be reauthenticating the keys once I revoked them. The app would not send anything out, I had to go line by line before I figured I should just refresh and paste some new ones in there. Very cool once it started to work!!
